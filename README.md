# Hey, I’m Luca! 👋

I’m a software engineer and aspiring architect passionate about designing structured, scalable, and predictable systems. My work revolves around building tools that enhance validation, compliance, and execution reliability in software architectures. Python is my primary playground, where I experiment with **modular design, backend development, and automation**.

I take inspiration from my roots in **Lucania, Italy**—a land of resilience and timeless architecture. Just like well-built structures that stand the test of time, I believe software should be designed with **precision, stability, and adaptability** in mind. 

## 🚀 What I Do  
- **Software Engineering** – Specializing in backend systems, runtime validation, and architecture design.  
- **Open Source Development** – Focused on creating tools that ensure software integrity and stability.  
- **System Optimization** – Working on improving execution reliability across different runtime environments.  

## 🛠️ Key Project: ImportSpy  
One of my key projects is **ImportSpy**, a validation and compliance framework for Python modules. It ensures that imported dependencies follow strict structural rules, preventing **unexpected failures, security risks, and inconsistencies**.

### 🔎 Why ImportSpy?  
- **Proactive Control** – Enforce strict validation on imported modules before execution.  
- **Dependency Compliance** – Ensure that all integrations meet predefined architectural rules.  
- **Runtime Stability** – Minimize failures by validating execution environments in real time.

## 💡 Always Learning  
I’m always expanding my knowledge in **software validation, automation, and system reliability**. My interests extend to **IoT, cloud computing, and Python performance optimization**. I love experimenting with **Raspberry Pi, Arduino**, and new technologies that bridge the gap between software and hardware.
