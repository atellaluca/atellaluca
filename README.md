# Luca Atella

**Software Architect · Backend Engineer · Systems Designer**

I design and build backend systems with a strong focus on:

- modular and plugin-based architectures  
- runtime validation and contract-driven design  
- scalable backend platforms  
- reliability and failure semantics  
- developer tooling and system foundations  

My work sits at the intersection of software architecture, applied research,  
and production-grade backend engineering.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus

- Runtime contracts and validation systems  
- Plugin-based and modular backends  
- Declarative DSLs for system governance  
- Fault isolation and fail-fast design  
- Data ingestion and validation pipelines  
- Distributed and cluster-ready architectures  
- Unified backends for heterogeneous data sources  
- Backend platforms for IoT and smart environments  
- Developer tooling for reliability and safety

## 🧠 Selected Work

### ImportSpy  
A runtime contract and validation framework for Python modules,  
designed around declarative contracts, formal failure semantics,  
and provider–consumer integration models.

Key concepts:

- runtime contracts and baseline constraints  
- declarative DSLs for contract modeling  
- rule-based validation engine  
- structured violation and diagnostics system  
- fail-fast integration semantics
