## Software Architect · Backend Engineer · Systems Designer

---

I design and build backend systems with a strong focus on:

- modular and plugin-based architectures  
- runtime validation and contract-driven design  
- scalable backend platforms  
- reliability and failure semantics  
- developer tooling and system foundations  

My work sits at the intersection of software architecture, applied research,  
and production-grade backend engineering.

## What I Work On

I specialize in designing backend systems that:

- integrate heterogeneous data sources  
- enforce runtime contracts and system invariants  
- scale across distributed environments  
- fail fast and fail transparently  
- remain maintainable under long-term evolution  

My projects focus on **system foundations** rather than surface features,  
with particular attention to:

- separation of concerns  
- extensibility through plugins  
- validation pipelines  
- diagnostics and failure semantics  
- architectural governance of dynamic systems

## Architectural Focus Areas

- Runtime contracts and validation systems  
- Plugin-based and modular backends  
- Declarative DSLs for system governance  
- Fault isolation and fail-fast design  
- Data ingestion and normalization pipelines  
- Distributed and cluster-ready architectures  
- Unified backends for heterogeneous data sources  
- Backend platforms for IoT and smart environments  
- Developer tooling for reliability and safety

## Selected Case Studies

### ImportSpy — Runtime Contract Validation Framework  
A framework for enforcing runtime integration contracts  
between Python modules using declarative models,  
rule-based validation, and structured failure diagnostics.

**Key themes:**

- contract-driven integration  
- declarative DSL design  
- validation pipelines  
- failure semantics and diagnostics  
- provider → consumer integration model

### Unified Backend for Heterogeneous Data Sources (SAFE)  
A scalable, plugin-based and cluster-ready backend  
designed to unify heterogeneous data sources  
under a single backend and a unified data model.

**Key themes:**

- plugin-based ingestion  
- data normalization pipelines  
- backend unification  
- scalability and clustering  
- architectural separation of concerns  

→ [View case study](case-studies/unified-backend/overview.md)

### End-to-End Real-Time Fleet Telemetry Backend (SAFE)  
A distributed backend system for real-time ingestion,  
normalization and exposure of vehicle telemetry data  
from heterogeneous tracking devices.

**Key themes:**

- socket-based real-time ingestion  
- CAN bus data normalization  
- telemetry pipelines  
- REST API service layer  
- scalability and fault tolerance

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

This portfolio is organized around **architectural case studies**  
rather than individual code samples.

Each case study focuses on:

- system design decisions  
- architectural trade-offs  
- validation and governance models  
- scalability and reliability strategies  
- lessons learned from real-world systems  

The goal is to present transferable architectural patterns  
and design thinking, not product documentation.
