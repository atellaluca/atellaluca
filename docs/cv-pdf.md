## Summary

Backend engineer focused on **integration-heavy platforms**, **runtime governance**, and **real-time systems**.  
I design evolvable systems that normalize heterogeneous inputs and enforce contracts.

---

## Core Strengths

- Platform backend architecture (integration-first, multi-tenant systems)  
- Plugin-based systems and modular execution boundaries  
- Runtime contracts, validation, and architectural invariants  

---
