# Luca Atella  
## Systems & Platform Architect

**Platform architecture, runtime systems, and long-lived backend design.**

I design backend platforms that enforce architectural invariants and evolve safely over time.

## What I Work On

I focus on building systems where **correctness, evolvability, and governance** matter more than short-term features.

My work typically involves:

- backend platform architecture for integration-heavy systems  
- runtime contracts and validation engines  
- plugin-based and modular execution models  
- real-time data pipelines and event-driven backends  
- heterogeneous system normalization (IoT, telemetry, embedded)  
- long-lived systems with strict architectural invariants

## Signature Work

### ImportSpy — Runtime Contract Engine

A declarative runtime contract system for Python modules that enforces:

- structural and contextual invariants  
- architectural boundaries  
- minimum execution requirements  

It is designed for modular backends, plugin ecosystems, embedded runtimes, and CI/CD validation.

### Unified Backend Platform (SAFE)

A plugin-governed backend platform for heterogeneous device integration.

Key characteristics:

- centralized CRUD and REST APIs  
- real-time updates via WebSocket  
- declarative UI schema (Widget DSL)  
- runtime validation and plugin governance  
- containerized and Kubernetes-ready

## Methodology Snapshot

My engineering approach is grounded in:

- contract-first system design  
- architectural invariants as first-class citizens  
- explicit runtime governance  
- deterministic validation and diagnostics  
- modular execution boundaries  
- test-driven development (TDD)  
- long-term maintainability over short-term optimization  

---

## Typical Application Domains

My work is particularly relevant for:

- plugin-based platforms  
- industrial and embedded systems  
- integration orchestrators  
- modular enterprise backends  
- real-time telemetry platforms  
- long-lived software systems
