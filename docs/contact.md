# Contact

I am always open to meaningful conversations around software architecture, backend systems, and long-lived platforms.

If you are working on:

- modular or plugin-based systems  
- backend or platform architecture  
- developer tooling  
- runtime governance  
- IoT or edge platforms  
- integration-heavy backends  
- cloud-native or DevOps-oriented projects  

and would like to exchange ideas, explore a collaboration, or discuss a technical challenge, feel free to reach out.

## Notes

I may take some time to reply, but I do read all serious and thoughtful messages.

If you’re reaching out about a project or idea, a short description of:

- the problem space  
- the system context  
- the architectural challenges  

is always appreciated.
