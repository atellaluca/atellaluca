## Profile

Backend engineer with strong experience in **modular system design**, **runtime validation**, and **integration-heavy platforms**.  
I focus on building introspective systems that normalize heterogeneous inputs, enforce explicit contracts, and remain evolvable over time.

I am the creator of **ImportSpy**, an open-source runtime contract engine for Python, and I designed a **plugin-governed backend platform** for heterogeneous IoT ecosystems.  
My work sits at the intersection of **software architecture**, **secure systems design**, and **real-time data pipelines**.

## Core Strengths

- Platform backend architecture (integration-first)  
- Plugin-based systems and modular execution boundaries  
- Runtime contracts, validation, and invariants  
- Event-driven and real-time pipelines  
- API design (REST) and streaming (WebSocket)  
- Operational tooling, containerization, orchestration

## Work Experience

### Technical Lead · Software Architect — Vemar S.A.S.  
**Apr 2021 – Oct 2024**

- Designed and developed a **modular backend framework** in Python (Flask + MongoDB) enabling plugin-based extension of REST APIs and unified data persistence  
- Architected the full **plugin lifecycle**: discovery, structural validation, runtime integration, and contract enforcement  
- Defined a **unified device model** to normalize heterogeneous IoT devices into a common schema  
- Built an event-driven pipeline with **real-time updates** for frontend dashboards  
- Designed and maintained Docker images for the full ecosystem, enabling reproducible deployment and scaling  
- Structured a distributed ecosystem of **8 independent services**, including a marketplace of generated web services  
- Designed UML models, ER diagrams, and database layers (MongoDB + PostgreSQL)  
- Led a team of 3 developers, coordinating architecture decisions and backend development workflows  
- Participated in **FLUIDOMOS (Horizon Europe)**, integrating the backend platform into an edge–cloud orchestration framework for decentralized IoT control

## Selected Projects

### ImportSpy — Runtime Contract Engine (Open Source)  
**Oct 2024 – Present**

- Designed and built a **runtime import contract engine** for Python  
- Introduced a declarative contract model (SpyModel) for enforcing structural and contextual constraints at import time  
- Implemented validation over CPU architecture, OS, interpreter, environment variables, Python version, classes, functions, and method signatures  
- Built high-performance validation logic compatible with embedded runtimes, CI/CD pipelines, and latency-sensitive systems  
- Maintained the full lifecycle: architecture, implementation, documentation, packaging, and release automation  
- Reached **15K+ installs on PyPI** and organic adoption in secure and modular Python systems

### Unified Backend Platform (SAFE Case Study)

- Designed a **plugin-governed backend platform** for heterogeneous IoT devices  
- Implemented centralized CRUD, REST APIs, WebSocket updates, and pub/sub pipelines  
- Defined a declarative **UI schema** (Widget DSL) to decouple frontend rendering from device specifics  
- Introduced runtime plugin validation using ImportSpy  
- Built CLI workflows for testing, packaging, Docker image generation, and Kubernetes deployments  
- Reduced integration complexity and accelerated development time by ~200%  

---

### Real-Time Fleet Telemetry Backend (SAFE Case Study)

- Built a real-time ingestion backend over persistent socket connections  
- Normalized heterogeneous telemetry into versioned schemas  
- Implemented runtime validation and structured diagnostics for data quality  
- Exposed fleet state via REST APIs and real-time streams  
- Designed for unreliable networks, scalability, and predictable failure handling
